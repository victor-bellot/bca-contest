1) Describe quickly here how do you control the robots to perform the advanced track.

Oscillate between follow_line and follow_walls until there is an obstacle at the front.

follow_line ends if there is no more line and there are walls around.

follow_walls ends if changeTime seconds have passed and (if a wall is missing or if a line is detected)

A line research starts between a follow_walls and a follow_line to ensure the presence of a white line.

The robot doesn't move at full speed (150) and turn (for adjustment with the white line) at 25.
The constants for linear regulation and derivation regulation are lower than in the speed challenge.


2) If you filter the measurements, tell a few words on how you do it.

Key filter : centered mean
-> if m = [e1, e2, e3, e4, e5] are the 5 last measures
-> take the mean of [f2, f3, f4] where [f1, f2, f3, f4, f5] = sort(m)

For filtering, 0 (no obstacle detected) is replaced by 1 (1 meter of distance).
