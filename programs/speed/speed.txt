Describe quickly here what you have done to go faster.

For filtering :
0 is replaced by 0.5 meters (that way, absence of data mean far away not close)
Use centered mean filtering
-> if m = [e1, e2, e3, e4, e5] are the 5 last measures
-> take the mean of [f2, f3, f4] where [f1, f2, f3, f4, f5] = sort(m)

const0 = 350
const1 = 700

Stop at 0.35 from obstacle
All spd at 255, never stop

A check for free direction (dist_sonar == 0) is made separately from the filtering to help end conditions

A line research starts if no line is found after a follow_walls
-> based on the history of adjustments, a direction is chosen

follow_line with memory (if no line is detected, continue the last turning command)
-> turn by subtracting 25 or 50 on a wheel

follow_walls ends if there is a wall missing or if the white line is detected

Five stages :
- follow walled line
- follow line for a left turn
- follow walls (follow by a line research if necessary)
- follow line for a right turn
- follow walls to obstacle
