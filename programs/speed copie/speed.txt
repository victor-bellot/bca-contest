Describe quickly here what you have done to go faster.

For filtering : 0 is replaced by 0.5 meter (this way, absence of data mean far away not close)
After spikes remove, take the mean of the 5 latest measures as filtered measure

const0 = 350  -> linear constant
const1 = 700  -> derivative constant

Stop at 0.35 from obstacle
All spd at 255, never stop

A check for free direction (dist_sonar == 0) is made separately from the filtering to help end conditions

A line research starts if no line is found after a follow_walls
-> based on the history of adjustments, a direction is chosen

follow_line with memory (if no line is detected, continue the last turning command)
-> turn by subtracting 25 or 50 on a wheel

follow_walls ends if there is a wall missing or if the white line is detected

Five stages :
- follow walled line
- follow line for a left turn
- follow walls (follow by a line research if necessary)
- follow line for a right turn
- follow walls to obstacle
